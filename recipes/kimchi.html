  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kimchi is a lacto-fermented dish from the Korean tradition. It is usually composed of a napa cabbage and Korean radish as a base, with additions like ginger, garlic, and spring oninons.</p>
    <p>I love this kind of food. Here I will be going through a recipe I found--the source is just under the first photo--and finally learning how to make it myself. The winter is not far, and I want to stock up on pickles and such delicious fermented foods.</p>
    <p>This dish promises to take about a week or longer to be ready for consumtion.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sea salt</li>
        <li>1 pound/500 grams Chinese cabbage (napa or bok choi)</li>
        <li>1 daikon radish or a few red radishes</li>
        <li>1 to 2 carrots</li>
        <li>1 to 2 onions and/or leeks and/or a few scallions and/or shallots (or more!)</li>
        <li>3 to 4 cloves of garlic (or more!)</li>
        <li>3 to 4 hot red chilies (or more!), depending on how hot-peppery you like food, or any form of hot pepper, fresh, dried, or in a sauce (without chemical preservatives!)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons/45 milliliters (or more!) fresh grate gingerroot</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix a brine of about 4 cups (1 liter) of water and 4 tablespoons (60 milliliters) of salt. Stir well to thoroughly dissolve salt. The brine should taste good and salty.</li>
        <li>Coarsely chop the cabbage, slice the radish and carrots, and let the vegetables soak in the brine, covered by a plate or other weight to keep the vegetables submerged, until soft, a few hours or overnight. Add other vegetables to the brine, such as snow peas, seaweeds, Jerusalem artichokes, anything you like.</li>
        <li>Prepare spices: Grate the ginger; chop the garlic and onion; remove seeds from the chilies and chop or crush, or throw them in whole. Kimchi can absorb a lot of spice. Experiment with quantities and don't worry too much about them. Mix spices into a paste. (If you wish, you can add fish sauce to the spice paste. Just check the label to be sure it has no chemical preservatives, which function to inhibit microorganisms.)</li>
        <li>Drain brine off vegetables, reserving brine. Taste vegetables for saltiness. You want them to taste decidedly salty, but not unpleasantly so. If they are too salty, rinse them. If you cannot taste salt, sprinkle with a couple of teaspoons (10 milliliters) salt, and mix.</li>
        <li>Mix the vegetables with the ginger chili-onion-garlic paste. Mix everything together thoroughly and stuff it into a clean quart-size (liter) jar. Pack it tightlyinto the jar, pressing down until brinerises. If necessary, add a little of the reserved vegetable-soaking brine to submerge the vegetables. Weight the vegetables down with a smaller jar, or a zip-lock bag filled with some brine. Or if you think you can remember to check the kimchi every day, you can just use your (clean!) fingers to push the vegetables back under the brine. I myself like the tactile involvement of this method, and I especially enjoy tasting the kimchi by licking my fingers after I do this. Either way, cover the jar to keep out dust and flies.</li>
        <li>Ferment in your kitchen or other warm place. Taste the kimchi every day. After about a week of fermentation, when it tastes ripe, move it to the refrigerator. An alternative and more traditional method is to ferment kimchi more slowly and with more salt in a cool spot, such as a hole in the ground, or a cellar or other cool place.</li>
      </ol>
