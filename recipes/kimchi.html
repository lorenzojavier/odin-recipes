  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kimchi is a lacto-fermented dish from the Korean tradition. It is usually composed of a napa cabbage and Korean radish as a base, with additions like ginger, garlic, and spring oninons.</p>
    <p>I love this kind of food. Here I will be going through a recipe I found--the source is just under the first photo--and finally learning how to make it myself. The winter is not far, and I want to stock up on pickles and such delicious fermented foods.</p>
    <p>This dish promises to take about a week or longer to be ready for consumtion.</p>
